### Tax Terminology

**Tax rules** identify what rates are applied to which customer tax classes (based on product tax class & destination)

**Product Tax Classes** are assigned at the product level. Different types of products are sometimes taxed at different rates. This information is best confirmed by your client’s designated tax professional due to the legality involved.

**Customer tax Classes** give a designation to customer groups or shared catalogs. Some customer groups are tax exempt in certain circumstances. Perhaps they are a government entity and fully tax exempt, for instance.

**Tax Rates** are the specific rate that will be charged by shipment destination.

Customer groups can be used for specific websites in the instance, even though the tax rules aren’t website specific. If you have a wholesale storefront setup and you need the default users to be part of a resale tax class, you may use automatic groups assignment for that website scope to manage where the users are assigned and set up appropriate tax rules for that group’s requirements.

Because shared catalogs link to a customer tax class, remember when mapping out shared catalogs for creation to take this into account.
