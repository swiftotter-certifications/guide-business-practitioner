### Buy-on-line / pick-up-in-store

New enhancements to MSI allows you to identify sources that allow pick up at store (in the source configuration). If the product in the cart is in stock at a pick up enabled source and the user is within the identified radius set in the store configuration, an option for pick up in store will appear in the shipping area of checkout.
