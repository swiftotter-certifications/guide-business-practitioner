### Source

These define where inventory is stored. Each website has a default source. Sources are configured in Stores > Sources.

You can specify a latitude and longitude for each source. If you also specify a Google API key in Store Configuration, Magento will calculate the distance between the shipping address and the source, choosing the closest source to reduce shipping costs.

Note that you cannot alter the details of the default stock or source or enable store pickup.
