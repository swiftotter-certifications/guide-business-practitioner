### Create quotes

The final major feature that we will cover in the Magento B2B module is the ability to create quotes with custom prices.

Once customers populate their cart with desired products, they can choose to request a quote (note that this feature can be permitted for all companies or individual companies). Once they submit the request, they are taken to a list of quotes in My Account.

Administrators can:

* update the contents of the quote
* write notes
* set a new price for the cart, apply a discount percent, or apply a discount amount
* set an expiration date
* send the quote back to the customer

The customer can then purchase the quote via the standard checkout workflow.
