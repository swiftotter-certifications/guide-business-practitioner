### Overview

The Magento B2B module is included with Adobe Commerce. This module provides common features that B2B websites require. Note that this module is not automatically installed.

This area will serve as a basic overview of B2B. If you would like additional information about this module, please consider our [guaranteed prep course](https://swiftotter.com/certifications/magento-solution-specialist-prep-course), as we delve deeply into B2B features and how to utilize them.

The B2B module provides the capability to:

* Manage company accounts
* Define access controls for company accounts so they can create sub-accounts and manage purchases for these accounts
* Create specialized product catalogs with unique pricing
* Create quotes that have custom prices: these quotes can then be purchased by the customer on the frontend
* Quick order by SKU
* Create requisition lists

We will take a look at the features of each of these capabilities. Please note that no amount of reading substitutes for experience. This test requires advanced knowledge of Adobe Commerce and a good understanding of Open Source.
