### Shared catalogs

There are many instances where merchants have custom product offerings and pricing for companies they sell to. The B2B module allows easy customization of this with Shared Catalogs (Catalog > Shared Catalogs).

If shared catalog is enabled, each instance has one Public Shared Catalog and as many Custom ones as necessary. There must always be a Public catalog enabled as this controls the pricing and products visible to not-logged-in visitors. Note that enabling shared catalogs automatically enables category permissions.

You can switch any Custom catalog to be a Public catalog. Doing so will convert the existing public catalog to be a Custom catalog. In addition, all companies who have been assigned to the existing catalog will be switched to the new catalog. All companies assigned to the new catalog will remain assigned.

Assigning products and prices happens through the Set Pricing and Structure. You can set a fixed price or a discount for products. You can also do this en masse. You can also import the unique pricing via special pricing import entity.

Shared catalogs function in a similar way as customer groups. As when you create customer groups, settings in the shared catalog will identify the customer tax class. This is important to note when reviewing requirements because if you have 2 companies with the same catalog and pricing structure and different tax rules, you will need to create separate shared catalogs.
