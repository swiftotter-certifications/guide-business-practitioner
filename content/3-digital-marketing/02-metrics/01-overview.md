### Google Analytics, GTM, Google Adwords

These tools are an effective way to monitor traffic and usability of a website. It is helpful for studying user trends.

* A/B testing
* Optimization and personalization
* Bounce rate: the number of visitors that return to the search engine (or referring website) without clicking to a new page. The lower this is the better. However, we have run into a number of cases where the bounce rate is very low because the page view event in Google Analytics was fired twice.
* Conversion rate: the number of visitors divided by the number of purchases. This is the number of visitors who make a purchase. The higher, the better.
* Average order value: the average amount ordered. The higher, the better.
* Session duration: the length of the average browsing session. The longer this is, either people are having a hard time finding what they want, or they really like the content on this page.
* Pages / session: the average number of pages that a visitor goes to during a given browsing session.
