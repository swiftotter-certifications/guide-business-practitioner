### Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager is a way to inject scripts (tags) into a website. For example, instead of adding Google Analytics, you can inject GA through GTM. One thing to note is that the default Magento implementation of GTM does not send enhanced ecommerce data to Google Analytics. You need a module to do that.
