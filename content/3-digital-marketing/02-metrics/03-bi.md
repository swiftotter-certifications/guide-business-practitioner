### Business Intelligence (BI)

Business Intelligence (BI) provides reporting that is specific to ecommerce on your store. Whereas Google Analytics is primarily focused on traffic, BI’s emphasis is on commerce, with other data sources such as Google Analytics bolted on.


BI is designed to provide insights around your data and answer questions like: “How are my orders growing month-over-month?”, “Who are my most loyal customers?”, and “Is my coupon strategy working?”.
