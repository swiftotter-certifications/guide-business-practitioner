### Social merchandising/marketing

Social merchandising is encouraging a customer to take actions on your behalf. Here are examples:

* Clicking the Facebook like button on your product.
* Writing a review of the product.
* Sharing your product via a tweet.
* Pinning your product image.

One reason this is effective is that customers rely on social proof, where others provide their word about the product or service that you are offering. As you can encourage your customers to provide more of this proof (through social merchandising) you and your customers win.
