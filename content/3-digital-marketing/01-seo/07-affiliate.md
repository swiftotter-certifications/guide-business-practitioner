### Affiliate marketing

Affiliate marketing is when other people link to you and you give them a cut of your profits as a “thank you” for the traffic or sales. This can motivate influencers to send traffic your way.

Adobe Commerce (Magento) has no system for tracking this, and you need to use a third-party module.
