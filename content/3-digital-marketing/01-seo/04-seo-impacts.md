### Common SEO impacts

While your job title may not be “SEO expert,” you do need to know some basic troubleshooting tips - ones that will save you and your merchants many headaches.

When creating a new website, ensure that every page on the old website redirects to a page on the new website. This is done by creating redirects in the admin (Marketing > URL Rewrites) or through web server configuration. Google has enough trouble browsing a website that has a new URL and file structure, and by not providing the new versions of these links, it is a recipe for a major disaster. Sadly, I have seen this impact way too many websites—all by competent Adobe Commerce agencies.

All duplicate content (staging or development sites) should be locked down with HTTP authentication (a password). You should also configure the robots.txt file to disallow access for all robots. You can also set in Store Configuration to put a meta tag on each page to prevent indexing or following links.

Ensure that all titles and descriptions have unique content. There are entries for this content on categories, products, and CMS pages. If you have multiple domains selling the same product, this is especially important to avoid duplicate content issues.

Utilize the metadata fields in your product listings and include image labels when adding images (either manually or via import)

Utilize a sitemap and submit this to Google Webmaster tools. You can configure this to generate this on a schedule.

Ensure Google Analytics is correctly installed and monitor it.

We have also been seeing a drop in search engine rankings where an old website is migrated to Adobe Commerce (Magento), but the content structure is not the same. For example, the old website might have few content-heavy pages (like combining category and product pages). Adobe Commerce (Magento) has many content-light pages. Utilizing a slow migration can help reduce loss of rankings, and ultimately, loss of traffic.
