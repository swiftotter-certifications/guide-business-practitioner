### GraphQL

This utilizes a new query and data syntax. The syntax is structured. GraphQL is strongly typed, so it is particularly useful for building frontend applications. In addition, its query language is powerful for creating queries to select data. It is an alternative to REST and SOAP for front end development. Magento teams are working on completing GraphQL coverage for all B2C use cases.

Because this is a new inclusion in Magento, its full scope of use cases is yet to be determined.
