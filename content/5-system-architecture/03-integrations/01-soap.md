### SOAP

This utilizes XML and a very structured language to communicate between endpoints. Typically, this represents server-to-server communication. Many server-side languages have a built-in means to integrate the connection directly into the code.

This is most often used in server-to-server environments, such as:

* ERP connections
* External system integrations
* Pre-built connectors

The SOAP API is strongly typed, so it keeps track of what is a number, a decimal, a string of text, and different types of objects. This provides a layer of validation without a developer writing custom validation code.
