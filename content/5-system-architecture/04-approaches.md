## 5.04 Differentiate between headless approaches and traditional

A Progressive Web App, or PWA, is a term for any web application that uses modern web technologies and design patterns to provide a reliable, fast, and engaging user experience. PWA websites are fast, secure, responsive, and cross-browser compatible. They are able to work offline and act like a native app on mobile.

* PWA sites use a variety of performance optimization strategies to provide a responsive experience or load content fast, even on slow networks.
* Secure HTTPS connections
* Responsive design strategies
* Cross-browser compatible
* Offline Mode - cache some content to serve when a user is offline
* Mobile users can add PWA sites to their home screens and even receive Push notifications from the site.
* Each page in a PWA site has a unique URL that can be shared with other apps or social media.

The RAIL model lays out the user-centric goals for PWA websites:

* Response – An application is receptive to the user’s request.
* Animation – It shows a movement to keep the user pausing.
* Idle – A PWA utilizes the “idle” second to cache content.
* Load – It loads under a moment.
