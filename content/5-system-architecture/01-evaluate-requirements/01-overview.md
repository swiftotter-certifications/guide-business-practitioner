### Overview

* Website: controls functionality of a website (like payment methods, product pricing)
* Store: controls the root category
* Store view: specifies text updates for languages

**When does a solution need to include multiple websites or stores?**

A Magento installation needs to include multiple websites when there is a requirement to:

* Localize (translations) for different languages or regions
* Target different markets or segments with unique designs or products.
* Inventory source delineation by domain/sales channel

Most times that a merchant would like to set up a separate instance, the same requirements can be accomplished in one instance, with the careful planning of scopes.
