### Multi-site infrastructure

The Magento frontend is browsed at a store view level.

As such, every website must have a store, which must have at least one store view. Any one of these levels can have multiple children (a store can have multiple store views). The lowest scope at which you can set a store domain is the store view. This means that you can register three domains and create one website, one store and three store views to power each domain.
