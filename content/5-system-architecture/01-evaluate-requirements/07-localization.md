### Localization Taxes and pricing in websites, stores, and store views

Magento pricing is either determined at the global or the website scope (customized in Store > Configuration > Catalog > Pricing).

Product tax classes are assigned and are configured in the website scope.

As detailed earlier in the guide, the three types of currency configuration can be set under Stores > Configuration > General > Currency Setup

* Base currency set at the website scope.
* Default display currency set at the store view scope.
* Allowed currencies set at the store view scope.
