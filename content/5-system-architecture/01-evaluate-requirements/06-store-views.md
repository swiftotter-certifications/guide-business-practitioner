### Store Views

The store view scope usually specifies translatable information, such as names, templates, currency, and language. You can also set the domain URL at this level. At this point few, if any, features are switched on or off.

Some specific examples are:

* Translatable attributes for a product
* Display currency (default &amp; allowable)
* Labels for ship &amp; payment methods
* Default tax destination
* Whether or not to include taxes
* Locale (language)
