### Cart Actions

This tab defines what happens to the cart. There are several options for Apply:

* Percent of product price discount: the Discount Amount will become a percentage and will be the discount for all matched products.
* Fixed amount discount: the fixed (not a percentage) amount that is reduced per product. The maximum value will effectively be the total price of the item.
* Fixed amount discount for whole cart: the fixed amount that is reduced as applied to the entire cart. If an item sells for $2, and you set a Discount Amount of $4, $4 will be reduced for each matched item.
* Buy X get Y free: the Discount Amount is how many to credit back as a discount. The quantity in the user’s cart will not increase. Note that this means a typical “buy one get one” promo is configured as Buy 2 get 1 (the customer buying 2 will get 1 free)

Here are a couple of noteworthy fields:

* Maximum Qty Discount is Applied to: this field governs the maximum number of items that are eligible for a discount.
* Apply to Shipping Amount: utilize the totals calculated to reduce the customer’s shipping total in addition to the subtotal of the order.
* Free shipping: use this field to select if free shipping is allowed on the order and if it applies to the entire order or to the matched products in an order.
* Add Reward Points: utilize the loyalty feature in Commerce to add additional points to a customer’s account.

There are powerful features that are often overlooked in Cart Price Rules. One is the ability to apply the rule to specific products in the cart which can be used in conjunction with the Conditions to provide multiple levels of filtering. Additionally, sort order and disallow further rule processing can be used together to create tiered rules. For instance, a “buy more, save more” sale.
