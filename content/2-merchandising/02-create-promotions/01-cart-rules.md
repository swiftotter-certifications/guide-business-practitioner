### Shopping Cart Rules

Shopping Cart Rules allow discounts and promotions to be applied to a shopping cart. These are configured in Marketing > Cart Price Rules.

These rules can be customized with Scheduled Changes in Commerce. In Commerce, the From and To fields are gone as of 2.3 and Scheduled Updates is how you configure the duration of these rules.

You are able to restrict Cart Price rules to:

* Customer groups
* Website
* Specific coupon code (or auto-generated)
* Uses per coupon code or customer

**Related Dynamic Blocks (formerly banners), Commerce-only**

You can associate Dynamic Blocks with a cart price rule to draw attention to it. This is helpful if you are requiring the customer to enter a coupon code for free shipping, for example.
