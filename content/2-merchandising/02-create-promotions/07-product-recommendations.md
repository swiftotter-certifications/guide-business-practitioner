### Product Recommendations

A new module available for installation Adobe Commerce (not for Open Source). It comes as part of the license, but doesnâ€™t install with the base installation. This module uses Adobe AI to create related product rules with more flexibility than was previously available. It comes with an easy user interface that provides a preview as you choose options.

A user can select their recommendation to show:

* Homepage
* Category
* Product detail
* Cart
* Order confirmation
* Be available for PageBuilder

The recommendation types available are:

* Most Viewed
* Most Purchased
* Most added to cart
* Trending
* Recommended for you

A user can designate the display label for the recommendations list, choose the number of products to display, and identify additional placement (bottom or top of main content) and position if there are several recommendations built to display in the same area.

There are many filters available to use. You can include/exclude products by

* Category
* Price
* Product details
* Stock status (out of stock or low stock can be excluded)
* Product Type
* Visibility
