### Manage coupon codes

You can create pools of coupon codes that are utilized. The purpose of these is to track usage from a mail or email campaign. You can also create single codes or have a promo set to apply without the need for a code. Each code can be set with a total uses restriction or total uses by individual user restriction. Note that a code with an individual user quantity restriction will natively only know when a logged in user has previously utilized the code.
