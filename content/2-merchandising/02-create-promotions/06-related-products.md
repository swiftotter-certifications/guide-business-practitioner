### Related Products, Upsells, Cross-sells

These are configured on the Edit Product page. Other than selecting and reordering products for each of these relation types, there are no additional options.

**Related Product Rules (Commerce)**

In Commerce, though, you can configure rules to display lists of products. The benefit of this is that an administrator can specify a list of products to apply the rule to and a list of products to display.

For example, if you have a category of Women’s Jackets, you might want to show Women’s Pants as related products and Women’s Shirts as up-sell products. Instead of going through each product in the Women’s Jackets category and selecting related products and up-sell products, you would:

* Create two new related product rules, one for related products and one for up-sell products.
* Specify the Customer Segment (if applicable).
* Set rule conditions for what products to match (which products the selected products will display on).
* Set rule conditions for what products to display.

Configuration for this is found in Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Rule-Based Product Relations.

You can also configure the store to use a combination of noted related products with the rules created.
