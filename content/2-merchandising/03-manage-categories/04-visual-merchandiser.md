### What is the visual merchandiser?

The visual merchandiser is a way to re-order products visually. Instead of trying to manage sort orders (Open Source), the administrator can simply drag and drop. Products are viewed in table or grid format (the latter contains the photo). In the sample data, note that there are many products assigned to a category that are “Not Visible Individually”. As you adjust sort order here, you might be adjusting non-visible products and thus won’t see changes on the frontend.

To make an attribute appear in the list of product conditions, you must add it under Store > Configuration.
