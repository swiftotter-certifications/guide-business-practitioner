### Categories

Products and categories are associated in the Catalog > Categories area. Categories are quite flexible when viewed as a navigation tool. They can be added to the top menu on the frontend (“Include in Menu”). This association is also editable in the product listing and via product import.

**Root Category**

A root category is the top-most category display on a given **store scope.** If the merchant needs a new category structure, you'll need a new store and a new root category.
