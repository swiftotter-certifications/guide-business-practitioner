### Display Settings

Categories can be viewed in three modes:

* Static block only: only shows content from the “Add CMS Block” attribute.
* Products only: only shows products and no static block.
* Static block and products: shows both.

The Anchor setting is used to enable layered navigation (the sidebar in a category). This setting also merges the current category’s products with the products from the category’s children.
