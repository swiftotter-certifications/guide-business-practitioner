### Products in Category

Products are added to the category manually (Open Source and Commerce) or automatically (Commerce).

To add products manually, simply click “Add Products” and choose which products you would like. Specify the appropriate position for these products. Note that the lower the position, the higher products are displayed. This can be troublesome as the default position is “0,” meaning, the top of the list.

To add products automatically in Commerce, select “Match products by rule.” Then you can add attribute conditions where the value matches or does not match. Additionally, you can set automatic sorting rules (such as by stock quantity or special price).
