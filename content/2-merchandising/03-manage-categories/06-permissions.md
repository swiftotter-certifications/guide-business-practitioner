### Category permissions (Commerce only)

A precursor to the B2B module was category permissions. Each category could have its own set of permissions to determine whether or not this category (or features) is available.

The criteria are the Website (can be set to All Websites) and Customer Group (can be set to All Customer Groups).

The administrator can then configure whether to allow, deny, or use Parent on:

* Browsing category (whether or not the category is enabled)
* Display product prices
* Add to cart

Note that when you enable shared catalogs, by default, category permissions will enable.
