### How can the visual merchandiser be used?

The visual merchandiser is used to fine-tune the display of products in a category. There are some cases where category navigation is preferred by customers and this helps to see how the new changes will look.

**Managing Categories**

* To reorder categories, click and drag. They will automatically be saved.
* To disable a category, uncheck “Enable Category.” Note that this can hurt search engine optimization as the existing category page will result in a 404. It is best to create a redirect.
