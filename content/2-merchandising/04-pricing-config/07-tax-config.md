### Tax Configuration

Adobe Commerce has extensive support for all forms of commerce taxation.<br>
These rules are configured in Stores > Tax Rules<br>
Configuration for tax happens in Stores > Configuration > Sales > Tax

Most tax calculation settings are configured at the website scope. Most tax display settings are configured at the store view scope. A big difference for tax displays between the EU and the US is whether to include tax estimates in the product prices. This can be configured in this area as well.

To determine the correct tax rate, Adobe Commerce must have three things:

* The product’s tax class
* The customer’s tax class (or default tax class)
* The destination

Adobe Commerce will use the above information to select the applicable tax rate. A store administrator can import and export these tax rates to simplify the administration of them.
