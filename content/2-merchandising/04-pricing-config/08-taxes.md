### FPT, WEEE, and Container Tax

The FPT (Fixed Product Tax in the US), WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive in the EU), and Container Tax (in Canada) are configured in the store in the same way.

Some taxation bodies require additional flat fees be charged for specific product types. A bottle deposit is an example of this. Configurations for these can be found in Sales > Tax > FPT.

**To add FPT to a product:**

* Enable Fixed Price Tax in Stores > Configuration > Sales > Tax > Fixed Product Taxes
* Create a new product attribute with the Fixed Product Tax type.
* Add the attribute to all related attribute sets.
