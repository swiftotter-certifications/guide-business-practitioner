### Shared Catalogs (B2B)

Shared catalogs are a pretty wrapper on tiered pricing.

Shared catalogs can have unique pricing structures or unique product sets. They can be set to have individual prices per item or a flat discount across the catalog. Shared catalogs are part of the B2B module and can be assigned to a company. Individual customers can also be assigned to a shared catalog instead of a customer group. Shared catalog pricing can be created in the shared catalog area or imported via special pricing import entity.
