### Checkout Price Calculations

The price calculation in the checkout utilizes more data points to determine the price.

In addition to the factors taken into account on the catalog (special price, catalog price rules) these affect the total price:

* Tiered price is taken into account
* Cart price rules are checked
* Taxes
* Shipping
