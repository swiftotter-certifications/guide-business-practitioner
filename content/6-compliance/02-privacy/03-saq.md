### Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)

To verify compliance, Level 2-Level 4 merchants must self-assess their organization. This questionnaire ensures proper standards are met and controls are in place.

The self-assessment questionnaires are labeled. We do not have time to go into each one, but I recommend being familiar with the labels. Here are the most common you will run into:

A: ecommerce (or mail/telephone-order) merchants who have completely outsourced credit card functions to a compliant 3rd-party. In my interpretation, this would be utilizing any type of redirection for payment. When someone enters their credit card, the URL in the address bar is the payment provider’s website (like paypal.com).

A-EP: ecommerce merchants who have in-page payment processing (Javascript or iframe), but the card does NOT proceed through merchant servers. In my interpretation, this would be Braintree or Stripe or Paypal Express.

D: merchants who do not fit into other categories. In my interpretation, if credit cards are processed through the merchant server, the merchant falls into this category.

Please take time to familiarize yourself with the quick-start guide. I highly recommend the requirements awareness training: it isn’t much money for the value that you gain.
