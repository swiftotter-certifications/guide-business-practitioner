### PCI compliance

When a merchant is “PCI compliant,” they are in compliance with the standards put forth by the Payment Card Industries. PCI compliance dictates how an organization must treat payment card data. The most important part of PCI-DSS is to limit your scope in any way possible. This reduces the opportunities for cardholder data to be accessed by unauthorized third-parties.

These standards are segmented into two primary areas of concern:

* PCI-DSS: data security standards. These cover the entire organization which accepts payment cards (credit and debit cards).
* PA-DSS: application security standards. This covers the application, such as Adobe Commerce.
