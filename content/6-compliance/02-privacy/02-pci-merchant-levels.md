### PCI Merchant Levels

There are 4 merchant levels: Level 1 through Level 4. These levels are primarily determined by the number of payment card transactions. Level 1 merchants have over six million payment card transactions in a year. As such, they are a higher profile for security breaches and need to take extra precautions. The other way to fit into Level 1 is if you have had a security breach.

Level 1 merchants are not eligible for a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (see next section). Their compliance must be signed off by a Qualified Security Assessor who writes up a Report on Compliance.

All other merchant levels have varying requirements for compliance. Most Magento merchants fit into Level 2 through Level 5.

If credit cards are accepted, the merchant must be PCI compliant. Remember, PCI compliance is whole-organization compliance and not “just the credit card” area.
