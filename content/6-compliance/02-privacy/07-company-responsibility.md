### Company responsibility

GDPR defines a basic framework (aka common sense) for how companies should treat customer data. If the company is switching technologies or something similar that could affect the security of their customerâ€™s data, they must perform a [data protection impact assessment](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/).

When a data breach occurs, the company must notify the applicable supervisory authority within [72 hours](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/). They must communicate to their customers the [impact](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/).
