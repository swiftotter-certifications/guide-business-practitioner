### Data protection

Companies must employ “reasonable” protection for their user’s data. Reasonable has not been tested or defined. Presumably, reasonable would be not to publish user data. What is user data? Anything that is personally identifiable (including IP addresses) or considered sensitive (see the links in the further reading for better definitions).

Users also have the right to [see their stored data](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) and request [it be erased](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/).

GDPR also sets up [requirements for companies to have a designated](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-37-gdpr/) Data Protection Officer or Data Controller. This person makes sure that policies are followed, that compliance is maintained, and is the point person for interacting with the supervisory authority.
