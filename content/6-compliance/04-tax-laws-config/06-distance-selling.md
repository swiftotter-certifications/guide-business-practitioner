### Distance selling (UK)

Distance selling is a UK law that dictates how a merchant must advertise their products. My understanding is that this law is pretty much common practice for reputable merchants (see the Further reading links for more details). Here are the most important points:

* You must display your business name, contact details, and address
* The price of the product (including taxes)
* How they can pay for their order
* How they can cancel their order
* Most websites specify this information explicitly. Depending on the country, tax must be included in the selling price (UK and the EU are two examples)

It is important to familiarize yourself with the overview of the law (see the gov.uk link below) as there are some exceptions to these rules.
