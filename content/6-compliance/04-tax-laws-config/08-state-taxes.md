### In-state and out-of-state taxes

Please note this is not tax advice, only a high level overview for basic understanding. Also note that tax laws can change fairly frequently and that there are many government agencies dictating these on federal, state, and local levels. Tax requirements should always come from the merchantâ€™s tax expert as they are ultimately responsible for proper tax collection.

In the United States, as of early 2019, tax is charged for shipments to any state in which the merchant has nexus (or a presence there). This nexus can be an employee, retail store, warehouse or headquarters.

US sales tax is calculated on top of the order. US residents know that sales tax automatically adds 10% (give or take) to whatever they are purchasing.

These rates are configured in roughly the same way as VAT, except:

* Prices are shown excluding tax.
* Many more rates need to be added to Magento.
* In some states, sales tax is NOT charged on shipping.
