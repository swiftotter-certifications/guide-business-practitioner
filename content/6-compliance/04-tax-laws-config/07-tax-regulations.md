### US and EU tax regulations

Two things in life are guaranteed: death and taxes. It is important for you to have a general understanding of taxes and a merchant’s legal requirements for this. If taxes are not properly collected, the merchant is left holding the bag.

**US**

The United States utilizes a sales tax system: the final seller charges a percentage of the purchase price and remits that to the government.

Unfortunately, this has become extremely convoluted. There are 50 states, but with the “streamlined sales tax” initiative, every city can charge their own tax rate. As such, there are thousands of sales tax rates. Many merchants are turning to 3rd-party systems (like Vertex, which is bundled with Magento) to resolve their compliance issues. Otherwise, a merchant can import tax rates into their Magento website.

**EU**

The European Union uses the VAT system. Each country has its own tax rate.
