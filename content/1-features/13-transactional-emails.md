## 1.13 Configuring and modifying transactional emails

Transactional emails are set up and enabled by default to notify your customers of new orders, invoices, shipments, and other configured activities. Each template will send based on the confirmation set in Stores > Configuration > Sales > Sales Emails. You can turn each one on or off, designate templates and set up email addresses to receive cc’d copies.

Templates can be revised in Marketing > Communications > Email Templates. You won’t see the core templates listed, but when you “add new template” you have the option to load any existing template to use as a start. After saving your changes, be sure to identify the new template is to be used in the appropriate configuration setting.
