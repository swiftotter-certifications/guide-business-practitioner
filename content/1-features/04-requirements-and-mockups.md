## 1.04 Interpret requirements and mock ups to determine if they can be met with native functionality

A mockup is a visual representation of a page or element. In order to properly estimate build time, you will need to be able to understand what elements are part of the core platform and which are customization requests. Please be sure to reference to Open Source and Commerce differences section, as they are not noted inline below)

The best way to learn all of these options is to review the Adobe Commerce user guide, as the possibilities are vast, but here is an outline of the most common features you want to be aware of.

**Content**

A store **design configuration** includes identifying a logo (for header & transactional emails). Dynamic content can be inserted using **dynamic blocks, related products rules,** or the new **Product Recommendations** module. **Default widgets** can be inserted in pages to show order status search, wishlist search, recently viewed, etc.)

**Categories** can be populated with dynamic rules and be configured to show products only, products and blocks, or blocks only.

Product pages can be configured to show **stock status, only x left** messaging, and be set to **allow backorders** (or allow **back in stock notifications**)
