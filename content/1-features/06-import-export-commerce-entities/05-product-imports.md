### Product Imports

Product imports for creating new products (or updating for that matter) are the most complex imports to prepare. The sample file may not contain all the fields that you are interested in importing. If you are having difficulty populating a column correctly or finding the correct column header, you can always run an export for your catalog (or a sample product you create manually) to identify the data you need. This is especially helpful when you are learning to create configurable, bundle, and grouped product imports. Also, note that because a store can have many custom attributes, the export will concatenate many attributes into the “additional attributes” column.

Creating a product via import will require the same mandatory fields as if you were creating the product directly in the admin.

It is best practice to always use the “data check” before importing a file. This will run your file through a validation and provide a by-line error report if there are any issues. The data validation has improved substantially in 2.4, in my opinion.
