### Customer Self Service Features

**Wishlist**

This allows customers to save items for later. “Save to Wishlist” is available on product and category pages. Clicking this link will ask the customer to register/login (if they haven’t done so already).

Both Open Source and Commerce have wishlist capabilities. Commerce allows for multiple wishlists.

New in 2.4, there is also a default widget to allow searches for public wishlists. If a customer creates a public wishlist and a user has a few details, they can locate the wishlist.
