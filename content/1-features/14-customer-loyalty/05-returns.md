### Returns (Commerce only) and Reorders

Customers also have the capability to reorder or return products, at their leisure, from their account. The link for creating a return is accessible when viewing each order (on items configured to allow) These are separate configurations, but are accessible in the same place to the customer.

Customers requesting a return can:

* Select item(s) to return, and specify the quantity, resolution, return, etc.
* Add comments to the return.
* After a return is approved, if the configuration is setup, they can print a return label

Customer reordering simply clicks “reorder” and the item is placed in the cart ready for checkout.
