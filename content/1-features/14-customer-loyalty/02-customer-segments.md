### Customer Segments

Customer segments allow an administrator to group customers based on properties or actions they have taken.

This is different from customer groups. A customer group is set at the time when a customer is created. That group can be changed any time. Customer segments are created after the fact. They are constantly updated on the fly.

**Use Cases for Customer Segments**

Customer segments utilize a different area of configuration than customer groups.

* **Dynamic blocks:** target these banners to customers who qualify.
* **Cart price rules:** you can configure a customer segment as a condition.
* **Customer segment report:** browse customer segments and view customers per segment

**Configuring Customer Segments**

Customer segments are configured with rules (like cart price rules and catalog price rules).

Each segment is either for visitors, registered guests, or both. This part of the configuration cannot be changed after the segment is created.

Here are the available selection choices:

* Customer Address (City, Company, Country, First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, State/Province)
* Customer
* Created at
* Date of Birth
* Default Billing Address
