### Rewards (Loyalty Program)

From the customer perspective, earning rewards can boost brand loyalty. Once the configuration and exchange rates are set up, a customer can earn points for actions beyond making a purchase including creating an account, joining the newsletter, etc.

Rewards for actions show in the account area immediately. Rewards earned for purchases will show up in the account after the order has been invoiced. The customer can use these as a payment method at checkout.
