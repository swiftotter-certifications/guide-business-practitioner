### Customer Groups

Customer groups are a way to categorize customers. By default, one customer group is set up and you can create more. You can also specify the default customer group in Stores > Configuration > Customers > Customer Configuration. Observe that you can also have the group automatically assigned based on VAT ID validation.

**Use Cases for Customer Groups**

Customer groups are used to configure aspects of pricing.

* **Tiered pricing:** customer groups are a selection criteria in the use of product tiered pricing. This allows a store administrator to give those in a specific customer group a better (or worse) discount.
* **Catalog price rules:** customer groups are filters to ensure the rules are given to the correct customers.
* **Cart price rules:** customer groups are a filter here, too.
* **Private sale invitations** (Commerce only)

Customer groups are assigned a tax class. This tax class can be used to create tax-exempt customers or configure additional rules.

Customer groups are configured in Customer > Customer Groups.
