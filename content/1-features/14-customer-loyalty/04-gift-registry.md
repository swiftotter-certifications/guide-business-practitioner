### Gift registry (Commerce only)

The registry is similar to a glorified wish list. The customer first selects the type of wish list. Then, they fill out information about the registry:

* Inactive/active
* Event date
* Event details
* Contact information

Administrators also have the capability to manage gift registries.

New in 2.4, there is also a default widget to allow searches for registries.
