### Checkout

You can configure the store to not allow **guest checkout** (this will ask a user to create an account to checkout) You can also utilize **category permissions.** You can set by category or across all categories to allow a customer group permission to see products, see pricing, and allow add to cart.

You can enable/disable the **mini-cart** (enabled by default), configure how many products will show, and how many will show before the scrollbar is triggered.

**Instant checkout** can be enabled and used by customers as long as the rest of the store configuration supports it. The store would also need to have a credit card vault holding saved credit card info. Once enabled, it would show up for a signed in user that has a saved credit card and default address details.

**_It is very important to review all configuration options associated with this, found in Stores > Configuration > Sales > Sales, Checkout_**
