### Free Shipping

In addition to setting up free shipping at a threshold, you can also set up a promotion for free shipping which can be done as a shopping cart price rule (which allows discounts and promotions to be applied to a shopping cart.) These are configured in Marketing > Cart Price Rules.

There are two actions available that can affect shipping price in the cart:

* “Apply to Shipping Amount”: will utilize the totals calculated to reduce the customer’s shipping total in addition to the subtotal of the order.
* Free shipping: Permits free shipping on the order and can be applied to either the entire order or just matched items

Promotional Rules will be addressed in detail later on.
