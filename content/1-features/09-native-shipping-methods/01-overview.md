### Overview

Carrier direct integration (**USPS, UPS, FedEX, DHL**) can be configured to show real rates (based on the client’s contract). The configuration allows you to identify which options to make available (2 Day, etc), if handling changes should be included, and what countries are allowable destinations for each carrier. It is also possible to configure a carrier to only be used for providing return labels for approved returns or only to be available for tracking links.

Every shipping method has several common configurations:

* Enabled. This is per website scope and enables a shipping method.
* Ship to Applicable Countries. This can prevent creating a new website—if certain destinations get certain shipping types.
