### Configuring Table Rates

Table rates are configured by selecting the 2 data points your calculation will be based on and uploading a CSV file into the Website scope (not Global). As with imports, there is a sample file available for download in this configuration area. The options for the calculation are:

* Items vs Destination (new in 2.4)
* Price vs Destination
* Weight vs Destination

Note that there is only one table rate that is available per order. In other words, you cannot use the table rate module to create an Overnight rate and a Standard rate that are both displayed in the checkout.
