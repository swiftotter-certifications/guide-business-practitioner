### Custom Variables

Custom Variables are a way to save commonly-used pieces of information and display them throughout the website. They are similar to static blocks (in idea), but their content is not parsed to render widgets. This makes them more suitable for displaying strings of text like a phone number, store hours, driving directions, etc.

Custom variables are set in System > Custom Variables. These are added through the WYSIWYG editor by clicking the variable button.

Custom Variables are easily injected into Email Templates by clicking the Insert Variable button when editing an email template.
