### Page hierarchy (Commerce)

One challenge in maintaining content on a website is how to structure it. This capability in Open Source is limited, at best. This forces merchants to look to other creative alternatives.

The hierarchy feature in Commerce allows CMS pages to be nested inside of each other. This is similar to how Category navigation works. You can add pages to the hierarchy in the Edit CMS page area.

You can also use the Content > Hierarchy tool to create Nodes. A node is a way to group multiple pages into a logical section. Nodes do not have their own page, even though you can specify a URL key. For each node, you can specify the next and start meta links to help SEO.
