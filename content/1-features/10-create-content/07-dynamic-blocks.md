### Dynamic Blocks

Formerly referred to as banners (if you see "banner" on the test, you can automatically discount that answer), these are different from widgets in that these inject content into specific places on the entire site:

* Content Area
* Footer
* Header
* Left Column
* Right Column

After selecting where the content will appear, the next thing to select is the customer segment(s).

Finally, you can use the WYSIWYG editor to add content (including widget and variables).
