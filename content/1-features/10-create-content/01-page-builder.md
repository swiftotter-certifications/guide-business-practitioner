### PageBuilder

PageBuilder is a powerful tool for building content and end-user experiences. Note that this is now available in Open Source as of Magento 2.4.3.

From an administrator's perspective, PageBuilder is easy to manage. You can go to Stores > Store Configuration > General > Content Management. There you can configure:

* Enable PageBuilder + Content Preview
* Google Maps API Key. This allows maps to be displayed on the frontend.
* Grid size

Before you take the test, make sure you are familiar with how to create a new CMS page with PageBulder.
