### CMS Pages

These render HTML on the frontend. With the addition of Page Builder (Commerce) editing content is even easier for admin users.

**Embedding external images in CMS content**

* Locate the image’s URL (right-click on the image and click Copy Link Address).
* Click the Insert Image button in the WYSIWYG.
* Paste the full address.
* Click OK.

**Managing multilingual CMS content**

Unfortunately, this is one of the less-intuitive parts of Adobe Commerce. There is no Store View selector for CMS pages or blocks (unlike most other areas).

To create language-specific pages, you create a new page for each language. That page is assigned to one or more store views (or All Store Views). The URL Key must be unique for each page + store combination. For example, if you have two pages with a URL Key of “privacy-policy,” you cannot have these both associated with the same store view.
