### Gift Accounts

Gift accounts are the accounting item that tracks the amount available on a given gift card. You will find this in Marketing > Gift Card Accounts.

A merchant can create a gift card and send it to a recipient. Most commonly, these are created when a customer purchases a gift card and it is invoiced (by default, but the gift card can be created when the order is placed).

Customers can then apply a gift card code to the shopping cart or at the payment method screen. They can also redeem a gift card in the “My Account” area.
