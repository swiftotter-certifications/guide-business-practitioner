### Reports

Magento provides approximately 27 different reports. Some of these reports are based on aggregated data that has to be compiled (see list in next section). That means that after some types of changes, the data is out of date and you need to refresh it.

It is important to familiarize yourself with the reports and the data that each displays.

**Reports > Refresh Statistics**

In this admin section, you can refresh several reportsâ€™ data for the last day or the lifetime. Note that refreshing the latter may render the admin panel unresponsive to you and slower on the frontend.
