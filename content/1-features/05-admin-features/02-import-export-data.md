### Importing and exporting Data in the admin interface

The ability to import and export data is extremely useful. Adding/updating data via import allows a user to test changes in staging prior to importing into production and makes it easier to keep the environments in sync. It also allows for scheduled updates from upstream systems or sources. Exporting allows you to review information for inconsistencies and to send information to downstream systems. This can be done manually or by scheduled jobs (in Commerce).

The menu items related to this are found in Systems > Data Transfer. In addition to separate import and export menus, you will also find an import history and a separate menu option for tax related imports.
