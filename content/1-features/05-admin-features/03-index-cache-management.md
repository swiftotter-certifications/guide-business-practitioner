### Index Management & Cache Management

These options can be found in the Systems menu in the tools section.

Index management allows you to see the current state of the indexes, invalidate each index, and set them to run on schedule or on save. It is important to note that setting indexers to run on schedule instead of save can be useful if many changes are being made in the admin. If they are set on save, you may continuously trigger reindexes and see performance issues.

The cache management area is where you can clear cache after making changes to content or configuration in order to see those changes reflect on the front end.
