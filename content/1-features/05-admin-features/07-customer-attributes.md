### Customer Attributes

Customer attributes are used to store information about a customer. Adobe Commerce provides the capacity to create and modify customer attributes.

There are custom attributes and system attributes (the ones that are automatically created when installing Adobe Commerce). The latter attributes cannot be deleted.

System attributes (and to the extent that custom attributes are created by a developer) are utilized throughout the application. For example, the Customer Group attribute is utilized by the Cart Price Rules and Catalog Price Rules.

What kind of customer attributes can be created?

* Text field
* Text area
* Multiple Line
* Date
* Dropdown (for configurable products)
* Multiple Select
* Yes/No
* File (attachment)
* Image File
* Swatches (for configurable products)
* FPT, fixed price tax (WEEE, bottle taxes)

**The difference in customer attribute configuration between Commerce & Open Source**

Open Source requires that attribute additions/updates be accomplished by a developer either in the database or through upgrade scripts.

Adobe Commerce provides a complete interface for creating and managing customer attributes.
