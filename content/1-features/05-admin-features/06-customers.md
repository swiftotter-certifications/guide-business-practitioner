### Customers

There are many functions housed in the customer menu. This is where you maintain your customer records and set up companies, customer groups, and customer segments.

As of 2.4, assisted shopping is available in the admin (Commerce only). While inside a customer record, you will now see “login as customer” available. Actions taken in this mode will also be included in the admin actions log.
