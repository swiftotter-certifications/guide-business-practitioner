### Bundle Products

Bundle products are somewhat of a hybrid between configurable and grouped products. The difference is that bundle products do not rely on attributes. A bundle product's options are created and configured. The children are then assigned.

Each bundle option's choice can be selected with radio buttons, a drop-down menu, checkboxes or multiple select.

The bundle product's price is the sum of the chosen bundle products. However, a merchant can apply a special price discount percentage to reduce the amount of the chosen products.
