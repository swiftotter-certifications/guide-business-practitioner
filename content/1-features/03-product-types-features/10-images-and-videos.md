### Images & Videos

Adobe Commerce allows merchants the ability to upload videos for products. Adobe Commerce supports Vimeo and YouTube videos. Before a merchant can display a YouTube video, they must configure a YouTube API key.

Videos are injected into the product media gallery. The video thumbnails can be used in the same way as normal images: base, small, thumbnail, and hide from product page.

Version 2.4 has a new media gallery that contains the same functionalities as the existing media storage, but offers an improved user interface and a closer integration with Adobe stock.
