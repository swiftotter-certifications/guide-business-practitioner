### Gift Card (Commerce Only)

Gift cards allow a customer to gift value from an online store to someone else. These are common in the United States and encourage people to give, even if the giver doesn't know what item or size the recipient would prefer.

Gift cards are physical or virtual. Physical means that it is mailed (and shipping is charged). Virtual means that the card is delivered by email. Amounts can be Open, meaning that the purchaser can specify how much they want to give, or it can be a fixed amount (limited to what is specified on the backend).

Once invoiced (or ordered, if specified in configuration), a gift card account with the proper value is assigned to the customer account and is ready for use.
