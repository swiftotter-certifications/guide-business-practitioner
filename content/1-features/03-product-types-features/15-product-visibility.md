### What determines if a product is visible on the storefront?

Note that visible is different from saleable. We will discuss the differences in the next section.

**For a product to be visible in search or a category page**

* Must be in stock or Display Out of Stock Products = Yes
* Must be enabled
* Must be associated with a website (or Single-Store Mode = Yes)
* Must not have the Visibility attribute set to Not Visible Individually
* Must be in a public or custom shared catalog (B2B)

**Can be sold on the storefront (saleable)**

Generally speaking, a product must be visible in order to be sold. A good example of an exception is the first visibility requirement. If a product is Out of Stock, Allow Backorders is enabled and Display Out of Stock Products is No, that product won't be visible in a category, but you can directly access the product page and order products.

**For a product to be saleable on the storefront**

* Must be in stock or backorders enabled.
* Must be enabled and NOT set to Not Visible Individually.
