### Downloadable Products

Adobe Commerce also allows merchants to create products that the customer can download. A downloadable product has Links and Samples

**Links**

A "link" is provided to a downloadable file. Once the order for a downloadable product is invoiced, a customer can then download it in their account. If the link is shareable, then the customer does NOT have to be logged in to access. However, each download still counts against the overall Max Downloads value.

Each link can have its own price and sample.

**Samples**

Ultimately, there are two types of samples: those associated with links and those added separately. You can add as many samples as desired.
