### Configurable Products

Configurable products combine the selection of multiple products into a single page. These drop-down selections are controlled by attributes: the parent is associated with an attribute, and the child products have this attribute specified (and are also associated with the parent). The customer does not see the final selection other than the selection choices they made. Adobe Commerce combines the customer's choices to find the product that matches the customer's final choice.

At the time of purchase, two products are purchased: the parent configurable product and the child simple product.

Child products of a configurable product are either simple or virtual products.

Configurable product attributes must be in the global scope and must be of the select or swatch types.

If a merchant sells many variations of the same product, this is likely a good option as it makes the catalog easier to navigate for a user. If you searched for a shirt and received 300 search results (each size and color variation showing in the results), it can be overwhelming for a customer to find the correct variation they need. Conversely, showing only the configurables on the catalog page allows a user to pick a style before confirming size & color.
