### Simple Products

This represents the basic unit of inventory. Most products that are delivered can be boiled down to a simple product. These are the products that are picked from stock shelves and shipped to a customer.

Simple products have inventory tracking. With this, product stock is kept up-to date (especially with the Multi-Source Inventory features)
