### Attribute Sets & Groups

Attribute sets contain attributes. Each attribute doesn't always describe every product in a store. For example, if a store sells both t-shirts and chocolate chips, the ingredients' list wouldn't be applicable to t-shirts. Additionally, the size attribute wouldn't be applicable to chocolate chips.

For this reason, attribute sets display only attributes that are applicable to the specific product.

In each attribute set, the administrator can create groups of sets (the tabs you see in the product edit screen).

In most cases, a store will have an attribute set for each "type" of product sold (apparel, food, tool, etc.). Additional attribute sets may be warranted for more specific types (like splitting apparel into "top" and "bottom" attributes).

When configuring attribute sets, remember that if an attribute isnâ€™t part of the attribute set the product is assigned to, you will not see that as an available field for entry. Also keep in mind that while creating sets can be helpful, creating too many sets or using ambiguous set names can hinder product maintenance in the future.
