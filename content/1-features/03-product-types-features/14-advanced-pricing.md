### Advanced Pricing

A productâ€™s advanced pricing provides additional options at the product level. You can identify a special price for the product within a particular date range or you can identify tiered pricing for a customer group. Tiered pricing allows you to charge a different price point depending on the quantity of a specific item a customer is purchasing.
