### Product Options

Product Options are a way that you can offer customizable options at the product level. You can add text fields, allow a user to upload a file, choose from options listed, or enter a date. Note that these can be leveraged for custom workflows, but core functionality just allows these fields to be created for input. For instance, you wouldn't want to offer this solution to a client who wants a customer to request an “arrive by” date as you’d have no control over what date the customer can choose (today? 6 months from now? last week?)
